.NET Chat for internal communication between devices connected to the same access point.

<h2>When the project actually began</h2>
This project began at high school, when I wanted everyone to communicate with each other in the lab. The original version also had many hidden features for remote code execution and key pression, automatically hiding, and other features that kept this program as secret as possible outside us students. This version is a generalised reproduced and more-properly-written version of that.
